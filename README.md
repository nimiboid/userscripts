# userscripts
This is my collection of user files.

## JIRA comments visiblity
JIRA lacks one highly required feature - set default visibility of comments. This userscript solves it. It requires however little digging and setting up. It has some minor issues, e.g. lock icon is not locked, but upon comment submitting desired comment visibility is set correctly.

## JIRA sortable subtasks
There are cases when the PO wants to use the sequence of the subtasks as a priority order. The built-in sorting mechanism is les than sub-optimal solution. This userscript enables a sortable table and fires AJAX requestst upon re0ordering the subtasks.
